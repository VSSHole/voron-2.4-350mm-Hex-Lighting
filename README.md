12x M3x6 SHCS or 12x M3x8 SHCS with washers
12x M3 T-nuts
26-30 gauge wire to connect strips together
24 AWG wire to connected to power
CA glue [I prefer BSI for zero hazing]
Black ASA or ABS
Clear PETG or similar

I used the soldering jig to wire up all the strips before glueing them into the printed channels
